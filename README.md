# Valheim

Script for many people to take turns hosting a world locally on their machine (not using dedicated server).

## Usage

Person who is hosting game for the night should start the game using __start.bat__. The script will then download the latest version available in the git and start the game. Person can then host a server normally with his/her character and invite other people to join.

When the game is closed the script will notice and take a copy of the current world state and push it.
